    Problem 2: Implementing an RNN with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

    Specifications (same as problem 1):
    - The implementation must be able to process mini-batches
    - Use appropriate matrix and tensor operations (e.g. dot, multiply, add, etc.) to implement the recurrent
      unit calculations
    - You may not use built-in Recurrent modules
    - You may subclass nn.module, use built-in Linear modules, and built-in implementations of nonlinearities
      (tanh, sigmoid, and softmax), initializations, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
    - Your code must start from the code scaold and follow its structure and instructions.
